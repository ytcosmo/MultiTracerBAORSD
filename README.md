# MultiTracerBAORSD
Here are the DR16 BAO and RSD measurements and covariance matrix in Wang et al 2020 (arXiv:2007.09010).

# sdss_DR16_MultiTracerELGLRG_FS_xi.dat :
The best-fit values with 1\sigma error bars for the parameters (DM/rd, DH/rd, f\sigma_8)

and 

#sdss_DR16_MultiTracerELGLRG_FS_xi_cov.dat :
The covariance matrix between (DM/rd, DH/rd, f\sigma_8)

Note that this measurement can be used together with the BAO&RSD measurements in the first six redshift bins, ie (0.2<z<0.59) from BOSS DR12 (https://github.com/ytcosmo/TomoBAORSD). The meassurements at redshifts larger than 0.6 from BOSS DR12 are eliminited, because BOSS DR12 galaxies in the redshift range of 0.6<z<1.0 are included in the DR16 LRG sample.
